# TypingApp
iPhone type trainer

This was one of my first apps when I was new to coding.

You type a passage and at the end you see a list of 
every word you typed from slowest to fastest and can 
tap on a word and practice it repeatedly. If you get 
a faster time you can see what your WPM would have 
been if you'd typed it that fast during the exercise.
