# TypingApp
iPhone type trainer

This was one of my early iOS apps, built while I was 
learning the fundamentals of app development.

You type a passage and at the end you see a list of 
every word you typed from slowest to fastest and can 
tap on a word and practice it repeatedly. If you get 
a faster time you can see what your WPM would have 
been if you'd typed it that fast during the exercise.

## Note on Content

This project was created as a personal typing practice tool.
Some passages reflect personal preferences and may include 
informal or explicit language.
