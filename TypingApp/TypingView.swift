        passage(text: "Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited. Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.", source: "The Holy Bible, Romans 12: 9-21"), // 4, tested

For as in the day of Midian’s defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor. Every warrior’s boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever.

He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands. But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.

        passage(text: "And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. And the Messiah cometh in the fullness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.", source: "The Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 2: 22-26"), // 7, tested
        passage(text: "In the Olam Ha-Ba, the whole world will recognize the Jewish God as the only true God, and the Jewish religion as the only true religion. There will be no murder, robbery, competition or jealousy. There will be no sin. Sacrifices will continue to be brought in the Temple, but these will be limited to thanksgiving offerings, because there will be no further need for expiatory offerings. Some gentiles have tried to put an ugly spin on this theology, claiming that Jews plan to force people to convert to our religion, perhaps based on their own religion’s history of doing exactly the same thing. That is not at all how Jews understand the messianic age. We believe that in that future time, everyone will simply know what the truth is, in the same way that we know that 2+2=4, and there will no longer be any reason to argue about it. It is much like a situation I witnessed at work once: two computer programmers were arguing loudly and at length about whether it was possible for a user to input data at a certain point in a program. Finally someone pressed a key and they all saw that nothing happened. Now they knew the truth, end of argument. When mashiach comes, theological truths will be equally obvious to mankind, and there will be no reason to argue about it.", source: "\"Mashiach: The Messiah\" from jewfaq.org"), // 8, tested
        passage(text: "A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him— the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord— and he will delight in the fear of the Lord. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears; but with righteousness he will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist. The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the cobra’s den, and the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.", source: "The Holy Bible, Isaiah 11: 1-9"), // 9, tested

        passage(text: "For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument is the turbo encabulator. Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance. The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the “up” end of the grammeters. The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.", source: "Bud Haggart's \"Turbo Encabulator\""), // 16, tested

        passage(text: "The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It’s based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass,” and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.” There’s also a system of prefixes for making things bigger (kilo-, mega-, giga-, tera-) or smaller (milli-, micro-, nano-) in multiples of 1000: think of your milligrams of medicines or your gigabytes of computing power. The metric system is decimal because it is always based on powers of 10. The Imperial system is based on the inch/ foot/ yard/ mile (length), the ounce/ pound/ stone/ hundredweight (weight/ mass) and the fluid ounce/ pint/ quart/ gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally not decimal: Length: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile- a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the furlong, pole, and chain. Weight/ mass: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America- somewhat confusingly!). Capacity: there are 20 fluid ounces in a pint, 8 pints in a gallon, and other units as well. Again the rules are slightly different in the USA. Their bizarre conversion factors and cross-continental differences are a bad blow for Imperial, whereas the metric system of prefixes deals effortlessly with the minuscule and enormous quantities of modern living- like microns or megabytes. But the real clincher for metric is how beautifully it has been designed: one cm3 is exactly equal to one ml (millilitre), and a litre of water weighs precisely one kilogram.

        passage(text: "This kind of coverage about Sabe by the mainstream media is cringe-worthy and embarrassing to those of us who’ve actually encountered these creatures. For us, no further “proof” is needed. This story portrays the whole subject of Sasquatch/Sabe as some sort of light-hearted little romp in the woods that can be undertaken by any old group of naive college kids out for a bit of a lark. The reality is we’ve had police officers, hunters and outdoors men, military combat veterans, ordinary hikers and campers as well as many, many first nations people who’ve encountered Sabe throughout North America and the rest of the world. Many of these encounters, like mine, were and are fairly benign. However, there are just as many encounters that are terrifying and very traumatizing. The large males of the species can be very territorial and very aggressive, especially when protecting a family group. We’ve had military combat veterans report that their encounter with Sabe while out hunting was exponentially more terrifying than any experience they’ve had in combat, and that nothing short of a .50 caliber round would likely be sufficient in terms of stopping an attack. That’s something to be taken seriously. So if you intend to go out in the woods, and knock on trees, and make Sasquatch vocalizations, just for the sake of satisfying curiosity or just to experience a bit of a thrill to see what it’s like to encounter one of these creatures, then be advised that you may not like what you encounter. Bear in mind that these creatures are very much the masters of their environment, and any person encountering one of these creatures in the wild may very quickly realize that they are completely outclassed, outmaneuvered and out-gunned, in terms of the size, strength, speed and stealthiness of these creatures. So once again, if you intend to go out in the woods to see if you can have an encounter with one of these creatures, don’t go alone. Don’t go without having a firearm and sufficient firearms training in how to use the weapon safely and effectively. Don’t go without having a personal locator beacon and a GPS navigation device. As much as possible become familiar with the area you intend to visit. Take a map, a compass, and any survival gear you may need. If you encounter one or more of these creatures and if they show signs of aggression, DON’T shoot first and ask questions later. As quickly and calmly as possible leave the area. Best of luck.

        passage(text: "It has been many years since Bigfoot became a cultural mystery and theories on his purpose continue to flood the internet and news. One of the most fascinating theories on Bigfoot is that he is an inter-dimensional or extra-terrestrial being. Bigfoot has been linked to UFOs since 1888. Some Native Americans noticed a “small moon” (UFO) depositing three “crazy bears” (Bigfoots) on earth. A more recent claim came from Reafa Hetfield of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1973. Heitfield and her daughter believed they saw both a UFO and Bigfoot touch down in their simple trailer park. Shortly after, the star ship and the inter-dimensional being disappeared. A few weeks later, a Pennsylvania farmer reported a similar incident. As absurd as these theories may seem, they are not misplaced. Just a few years before the Bigfoot UFO sightings in Ohio and Pennsylvania, the CIA investigated a sighting at Presque Isle State Park. This sighting also had a UFO and Bigfoot. Ultimately, the CIA dismissed the creature as an ordinary raccoon, but they never could explain the UFO. Even though the CIA disbanded this case, the theory that Bigfoot is an inter-dimensional does disprove other doubts. Many believe Bigfoot is real, while others consider him a myth. One of the main reasons researchers have disputed Bigfoot’s existence is the lack of fossils. Even though there have been a number of Bigfoot sightings, no solid evidence of its life has been found. The “Bigfoot is an inter-dimensional being” theory solves this mystery. Bigfoot’s consistent travel through various dimensions would explain the lack of physical proof. Some claim to have seen him disappear through flashes of light- these flashes of light are believed to be portals. Bigfoot can quickly travel from one dimension to another, analyzing and helping each world. What’s particularly interesting about this theory is the skepticism behind it. Even some of the most intense cryptozoologists deny this idea. There is proof, research, and belief that this could be the truth behind Bigfoot, but very few believe it.", source: "Is Bigfoot a Supernatural Being? from WakingBear.org"), // 136, tested
        passage(text: "What signs do sasquatches use? Tree teepees are a typical sign that indicates home territory, said Claude. The number of sticks in the teepee could be the number of members in a family. To create the teepee, they might take a small tree and lean it against the branch of a larger tree. “The dead giveaway that sasquatch did it is, half the time the bottom of the tree is up in the air,” he said. It didn’t fall there naturally that way because it wouldn’t be upside down. There are usually not stumps around either from where the trees could have come from. They might also take a sapling, bend it and put a log on top of it to hold it down. And they can twist saplings. These can be used to mark an established pathway. They have mental capabilities and spiritual powers. Claude said people don’t realize sasquatches could create utter mayhem if they wanted. They can make people ill at the drop of a hat. He calls it being “zapped.” Most other sasquatch researchers he knows have had similar experiences when they go into areas where sasquatches don’t want them to be. Once while driving through Oklahoma when he sensed the presence of a large male.

        passage(text: "Henry is one of the most complex and profound characters in the Silent Hill franchise. Unlike the other protagonists where everything is shown to the player, to know who Henry really is, you need to be like him: be an observer. The developers left clues throughout the campaign, through gameplay, Henry’s comments on objects, and his actions throughout the story. This is the only Silent Hill that starts with a narrator. The narrator introduces us to the events in Henry’s life, creating a distance between us and the protagonist. Henry had a bad childhood, according to himself when analyzing one of his photos as a child. He says that it was not a sentimental time for him, leading to several problems that he would have, one of them being social anxiety. Before the chains appeared on the door, Henry had always been trapped, although not physically. He never wanted to interact with people on the outside. His last name “Townshend” means “on the extremity of a town,” related to the fact that he is isolated from the rest of Ashfield. He became a reclusive guy, as he developed communication problems. He didn’t understand Cynthia’s flirting, startled Andrew DeSalvo, and there was that failed handshake attempt with Braintree. Having difficulty interacting with others, Henry decided to adopt silence as a defense mechanism and isolate himself so as not to be judged as weird and attacked. Another representation of Henry’s fear of being judged by others is related to the monsters in the game who stare at Henry for a while before attacking him. Having a lonely and suffering life has caused Henry to not let his feelings show to others, making him someone very empty and causing him to act strange in situations. He reacts to Cynthia’s death in a totally calm and cold way and also thought that hugging Eileen would be the best way to calm her down in the hospital. Henry also shows signs of being someone who is depressed and who possibly has some other neurotic problems, for it had been two years since he had moved into the apartment and there were still moving boxes containing his belongings and the place was poorly decorated. He could not finish his chores and forgot why he had done things. He makes comments such as wondering if his shoes are his. During the time he was trapped by Walter in his room, neither friends nor family came looking for him. The only one who truly cared about Henry during the entire game was Eileen, she was the only one that Henry showed any feelings of affection for and was attracted to. Henry wrote and took pictures of activities in his daily life as it was a way he found to express himself in his lonely moments. Henry also used to observe others through the window. He observed a world that he was never a part of. This is why the game has a narrator at the beginning, as if we are watching Henry just like he watches others from afar. He is there, isolated; you can’t reach him and he can’t reach you. Like Henry, Walter also had a bad childhood. He was abandoned by his parents, raised and abused by cultists. He was trapped in a water prison. When he grew up he became homeless. The only gift he received in life was a doll that Eileen had given him when she was a child. Walter finds many similarities with Henry and identifies with him. Henry is the only victim with whom Walter interacts and has conversations. He even gives Henry the doll, again, the only gift he had ever received in his life, representing that Walter recognized Henry as an equal and that he understood him. They are two lonely individuals forced to endure atypical hardships in life and are excluded for it. The difference is that Walter had The Order to influence his decisions and Henry did not. If their roles had been reversed, it would have been no different. Henry had the opportunity to choose, and despite the hardships he faced, he chose to be someone altruistic, not caring about the risk he would have to face to protect people he didn’t even know. Silent Hill 4: The Room showed us that to have male protagonists as heroes, it is not necessary for them to be strong, intelligent or skilled, that people like Henry, who is not the typical ideal hero, can be heroes too. And they don’t have to change who they are to do that. It’s things like these that make Silent Hill 4 my favorite game of all time.", source: "nikobowling1606 commenting on Silent Hill 4: The Room Walkthrough"), // 159, tested
        passage(text: "Dyson: Look, we’re dealing with a person who has not only radically emboldened the prospects of bigotry in this country- the resurgent hate that he has articulated- if you can’t beat them, join them. He opposes Pat Buchanan on the one hand, and then subsequently when the real beliefs emerge, his vicious- it’s a cornucopia of hate that’s been brashly articulated of a man of manifest lack of serious coherence, chaotic intelligence and the lack of an ability to really express himself by not only pulling upon the strands of history, but refusing to take into consideration what’s going on today. So I think in one sense, if we’re going to talk about- if we’re going to be honest about Donald Trump, he has not helped black people, he has not enabled African-American people to move forward. He is riding a crest and a wave of economic prosperity put in place by his predecessor Barack Obama. He has refused to acknowledge the centrality of police brutality and unarmed black people being assaulted by police in this country. The reality is that Donald Trump, while claiming through rhetoric to be for the blacks, what he has done is undermine the African-American people, to exist in a country where it’s not only about the economic facts and the wherewithal we contend with, it is about the tone, it is about the rhetoric, it is about the atmosphere that has been unleashed here. And Donald Trump has done something very dangerous, and destructive. He can’t see the difference between an anti-fascist and a person who supports it. He can’t see the difference between somebody who’s against black people and who’s for them. He negates the ability to say, look, I believe in rational, civil discourse in America, but I take aside morally and politically- Owens: If I may interject for a second- Dyson: Let me finish. Melber: We’ll go to the professor and back to you, Candace. Dyson: Here we are, 53 years past the Voting Rights Act. We’ve seen the resurgence of an attempt to nullify and destroy that black vote. We’ve seen attempts to somehow circumnavigate around black political citizenry and agency. So all I’m saying is, if we’re concerned about black people, we’ve got to be concerned about poverty, inequality, lack of access to education, plus the kinds of sorts of violence we see directed toward black people in this country. Owens: Sorts of violence being directed towards black people. Am I black? I am a black conservative and I am not hearing anything said about the fact that about 25 white Democrats assembled to kick me out of a restaurant yesterday to throw water and to throw eggs at me because I’m a conservative that supports Donald Trump. Dyson: Bless you. Owens: The very same Donald Trump that has not- Obama did not do this. President Trump has been slashing regulations, and it has brought this economy to a place that it’s never been at. We have unemployment all-time low for both women, you brought up women, gays, black people, unemployment is at an all-time low across the board. You guys refuse to acknowledge the truth we’re doing better. Fascists, Antifa attacked me, and an all-black police force in Philadelphia and they claim to be fighting racism. How is it plausible, professor, that you allowed this to happen to your community because you decided that because we’re ideological conservatives you are okay with this.

It’s hard to believe now, but Nogizaka’s wardrobe budget was a fraction of what it is currently; Nogizaka’s “Guru-Ka” costumes must have paled in comparison to the costumes worn by Rena-san and her AKB sisters.

As an entertainer she has brought joy to millions, and her current profession brings a message of empathy and compassion to countless others who struggle with emotional challenges. Today also marks the 10th year anniversary of the inaugural performance of Nogizaka’s Under Live concert series held on April 13th, 2014, at the conclusion of the National Handshake event at the Makuhari Messe complex in Chiba, Japan.

Since that day, the Under Live concept has grown into a semi-annual performance that many consider to be the “Gold Standard” of Idol shows. Springtime is always a time of renewal and fresh hope, and the good news this season of Nakamoto-san and Matsui-san both serving up wedding announcements is cause for celebration. I’ve always believed that Nogizaka46’s bonds transcend graduation, and my faith in that strength has been reinforced recently with members who witnessed those early ups and downs sharing their social media posts of time spent together.

When the time came, she was overjoyed to see all her little ducklings emerge, except for one egg that was much larger than the others. When it finally hatched, the mother was shocked to see a strange-looking duckling with gray feathers, unlike her other cute yellow ducklings. Feeling worried and ashamed of her odd-looking offspring, the mother duck couldn’t help but notice how different he was from the rest of the ducklings. They often teased and ridiculed him for being so ugly, which made the poor duckling feel even more isolated and unloved. Despite such treatments, the ugly duckling continued in attempts to find longing, and as so luck would have it, the ugly duckling found another duckling willing to engage with him. They were about days in joy, talking and having fun, but as the days continued and familiarity set in, they stopped seeing each other. One day the ugly duckling said to himself in thought, “I have come to an actuality and not a fact I unsuspected but rather one that bellowed within me for a long time to come; yes, indeed, I had known of such a misfortunate truth, and it may at first render me nearly pallid. However, it is within my nature to merely accept my condition, for what am I to do with my evident confusion about duckling interaction? Mine is a crumbling facade. Oh, the words that come out of my mouth ring ever hollow. It is ever so clear I am not one to entertain or to be engaged with, for there is naught but a poor parody of duckling interaction. What little I understand of it is a perverse misunderstanding, a faulted mimicry so contorted it should only bring about shame. And to further my findings, I am of no interest.

        passage(text: "From day one it was like society was this violent, complicated dance and everybody had taken lessons but me. Knocked to the floor again, climbing to my feet each time, bloody and humiliated. Always met with disapproving faces, waiting for me to leave so I’d stop fucking up the party. They wanted to push me outside, where the freaks huddled in the cold. Out there with the misfits, the broken, the glazed-eye types who can only watch as the normals enjoy their shiny new cars and careers and marriages and vacations with the kids. The freaks spend their lives shambling around, wondering how they got left out, mumbling about conspiracy theories and bigfoot sightings. Their encounters with the world are marked by awkward conversations and stifled laughter, hidden smirks and rolled eyes.

        passage(text: "Solving the following riddle will reveal the awful secret behind the universe, assuming you do not go utterly mad in the attempt. If you happen to know the awful secret behind the universe, feel free to skip ahead. Let’s say you have an ax. Just a cheap one, from Home Depot. On one bitter winter day, you use said ax to behead a man. Don’t worry, the man was already dead. Or maybe you should worry, because you’re the one who shot him. He had been a big, twitchy guy with veiny skin stretched over swollen biceps, a tattoo of a swastika on his tongue. Teeth filed into razor-sharp fangs- you know the type. And you’re chopping off his head because, even with eight bullet holes in him, you’re pretty sure he’s about to spring back to his feet and eat the look of terror right off your face. On the follow-through of the last swing, though, the handle of the ax snaps in a spray of splinters. You now have a broken ax. So, after a long night of looking for a place to dump the man and his head, you take a trip into town with your ax. You go to the hardware store, explaining away the dark reddish stains on the broken handle as barbecue sauce. You walk out with a brand-new handle for your ax. The repaired ax sits undisturbed in your garage until the spring when, on one rainy morning, you find in your kitchen a creature that appears to be a foot-long slug with a bulging egg sac on its tail. Its jaws bite one of your forks in half with what seems like very little effort. You grab your trusty ax and chop the thing into several pieces. On the last blow, however, the ax strikes a metal leg of the overturned kitchen table and chips out a notch right in the middle of the blade. Of course, a chipped head means yet another trip to the hardware store. They sell you a brand-new head for your ax. As soon as you get home, you meet the reanimated body of the guy you beheaded earlier. He’s also got a new head, stitched on with what looks like plastic weed-trimmer line, and it’s wearing that unique expression of “you’re the man who killed me last winter” resentment that one so rarely encounters in everyday life. You brandish your ax. The guy takes a long look at the weapon with his squishy, rotting eyes and in a gargly voice he screams, “That’s the same ax that beheaded me!” IS HE RIGHT?", source: "David Wong, John Dies at the End"), // 188, tested
        passage(text: "I glanced into the open kitchenette at one end of the trailer, then turned and walked down a short hallway to the other end. I pushed through a closed door leading to what had to be a bedroom— and stopped. I was suddenly looking out over a snow-dusted field, a range of mountains spiking into a stunning violet sky from the horizon. Not a picture, that’s not how it struck me. It was like that end of the trailer had been chainsawed off to reveal the outdoors, only if that had really happened I would’ve only seen the neighbor’s rusty trailer and an abandoned Oldsmobile floating among the weeds. What I saw instead took my breath away. I stepped backward into the hallway, dizzy, disoriented, afraid I would be sucked in somehow. It took almost a minute to realize what I was looking at. It was a painting. A floor-to-walls-to-ceiling mural. He had painted the walls, the trim on the windows, the damned glass in the window. He painted over the curtains, painted the carpet, painted the sheets and wrinkled comforter on the unmade bed so that, when viewed from the doorway, the effect was beyond photographic. There was a half-full water glass on the nightstand, and a sprout of ice-coated weeds painted on the wall continued on the nightstand and onto the glass. There was a little crack in the glass and the artist incorporated it into the painting, the fracture becoming a glint of sunlight off an ice-covered leaf. The effect was too much. It gave me a heaviness in my gut like the first time I saw a skyscraper when I was a kid. Picasso could not have done this, not if he had a lifetime to devote to it. Step on that carpet and disturb the texture, or brush against the comforter and the effect would be ruined. Whoa. Just… whoa. I don’t know how long I stood there, absorbing it, overwhelmed by the details. There’s a deer, complete with little hoofprints in the snow. A happy little cabin, the family in the yard… As I took in those little details, my amazement began to sour, congealing into a cold dread. The cabin on the mountainside, that’s not a little tree out front. It’s a makeshift cross, with a man hanging from it. His legs have been cut off. The woman standing next to it… look at the infant in her arms. It has a single, curved horn coming out of its skull. And unfortunately for the old man, the baby still looks hungry. The frozen pond in back, those aren’t reeds sticking up through the ice all across the surface. Those are hands. And that deer? It has a huge cock, making a little trench in the snow behind it… I closed the door, deciding to never open it again.", source: "David Wong, John Dies at the End"), // 189, tested

Oh, and I had one hamburger that started mooing when I ate it.” He glanced at me. “You remember that?” I grunted, said nothing. It wasn’t mooing, John. It was screaming. Shelly didn’t look like she was listening anymore. “I call it Dante’s Syndrome,” John said. I had never heard him call it any such thing. “Meaning, I think Dave and I gained the ability to peer into Hell. Only it turns out Hell is right here, it’s all through us and around us and in us like the microbes that swarm through your lungs and guts and veins. Hey, look! An owl!” We all looked. It was an owl, all right. “Anyway,” I broke in, “we just did a couple of favors for people, eventually word got around.” I felt like that was enough background and I wanted to stop John before he got to the part where he says he kept eating that screaming hamburger, down to the last bite.", source: "David Wong, John Dies at the End"), // 192, tested
